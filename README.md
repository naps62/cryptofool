# Cryptofool

A set of foolish scripts to get info on Cryptocurrencies exchange rates

## Wait, another one?

Yep. Another one.


## What does this do exactly?

Currently not much:

* get exchange rates from coinmarketcap.com, and present them in a UNIX'able way
    (as you, you can easily `grep` and `cut` the results to incorporate in your
    shell somehow)

## But really, why?

I was constantly visiting coinmarketcap to get a glimpse of the market, and then
trying to remember how much I had on my different wallets & exchanges
Blockfolio wasn't working for me, since it requires manual updates, which
I constantly forget to do...
